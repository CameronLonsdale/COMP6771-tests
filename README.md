# COMP6771 tests
Publically shared tests for UNSW's Advanced C++ Programming course.
Feel free to make a pull request adding more tests.

This repository will become private and only include people who have contributed
tests in assignment 1 or who specifically ask me to be added later in the semester
so as to encourage contributions by everyone. :)

Assignment 1
============
To contribute please add a file titled `in-NAME` and `out-NAME` (where
`NAME` is an arbitrary alphanumeric string) into the asst1 directory. You can
also optionally specify your own custom dictionary of words by adding
`dict-NAME`.

The `in-NAME` file should simply contain stdin while `out-NAME` contains the valid
word ladders seperated by newlines and formatted according to the spec. (`test.sh` worries
about adding the input prompts) 

To run all tests simply run `test.sh EXECUTABLE_PATH` from within the asst1 dir.

Assignment 2 
============
Coming soon.
Assignment 3
============
Coming soon.
Assignment 4
============
Coming soon.
Assignment 5
